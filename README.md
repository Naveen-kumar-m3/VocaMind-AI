# Mental Health Risk Assessment System

A Machine Learning–Based Approach for Early Identification of Mental Health Risks

---

## 📌 Overview
The **Mental Health Risk Assessment System** is a machine learning–based project designed to support the **early identification of mental health risk patterns** using behavioral and textual data. The system applies supervised learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to analyze user inputs and classify mental health risk levels in a responsible and ethical manner.

This project focuses on **risk assessment and monitoring**, not clinical diagnosis, making it suitable for research, academic projects, and real-world exploratory applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze behavioral and textual data related to mental well-being  
- To apply machine learning models for mental health risk classification  
- To use NLP techniques for processing text-based inputs  
- To provide an ethical, non-diagnostic decision-support system

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Survey-based mental health datasets  
   - Textual inputs such as self-reflections or responses  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Data cleaning and normalization  
   - Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization)  

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Statistical features from survey data  
   - TF-IDF and sentiment features from text  

4. **Model Development**  
   - Supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest  
   - Model evaluation using standard performance metrics  

5. **Risk Assessment Output**  
   - Classification of mental health risk levels for monitoring purposes

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- NLTK / spaCy  
- Matplotlib

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
This system is intended **only for educational and research purposes**.  
It does **not provide medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations**.  
Predictions generated by the system should not replace professional mental health evaluation.
